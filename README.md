## What this bot will do:
- When a new user joins your discord, our bot will check for Towny Resident data and automatically associate their relationship ot the Discord Owner. The bot will automatically assign enemies of your nation the role, "Enemy" and etc.
- This bot can also manage nicknames with `!syncLink` but the person issuing the command must have the role "@Operator"
- If no roles are made, if the bot has the permission, it will make them itself.
